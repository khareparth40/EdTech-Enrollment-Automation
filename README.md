Problem Statement
An EdTech startup struggles with missed follow-ups and slow student enrollment due to manual lead tracking. This project uses Salesforce CRM to automate lead assignment, follow-up tasks, and reporting—streamlining the enrollment process and improving counselor performance.

 Phase 1: Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis

 1. Requirement Gathering

The EdTech startup receives student inquiries through its website and social media campaigns. These inquiries need to be captured in Salesforce and followed up by counselors. The current manual process leads to missed follow-ups and poor visibility into counselor performance.

**Key Requirements:**
- Capture student inquiries as Leads.
- Assign counselors based on region or course interest.
- Automate follow-up tasks and email alerts.
- Track lead conversion and counselor performance.
- Prevent duplicate student entries.

 2. Stakeholder Analysis

| Stakeholder | Role | Needs |
|-------------|------|-------|
| **Admin** | Configures and manages Salesforce | Clean data, automation, visibility |
| **Counselor** | Follows up with student leads | Timely reminders, student info |
| **Student** | Submits inquiry | Fast response, smooth enrollment |
| **Manager** | Oversees team performance | Dashboards, conversion metrics |

3. Business Process Mapping

**Enrollment Flow:**
1. Student submits inquiry → Lead created in Salesforce  
2. Lead assigned to counselor → Follow-up task auto-created  
3. Counselor contacts student → Lead converted to Student  
4. Enrollment record created → Tracked in reports

This flow will be automated using Process Builder or Flow Builder and supported by validation rules and dashboards.
